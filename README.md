I was trying to decide how to respond to Donald Trump's election.  I considered:

1. Moving to New Zealand
2. Spending the next four years drunk
3. Using my software skills to get Democrats elected.

My wife wouldn't go for the first one and after three nights of heavy
drinking the second one isn't as appealing as it sounds at first (and
my wife didn't really like that one either).  So it's time to write some software.

As I thought about the third idea, "getting Democrats elected", it isn't the
right goal.  What I really want to do is:

> Get **more** Democrats elected

What's the difference?  Anything I (and hopefully "we") do probably
wouldn't improve Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.  It seemed
pretty well run to me.  I'm not sure what we could've done to improve
any of the Democratic senate candidates that lost to a Republican
politician.  Or even any of the Democrats that lost to a Republican
for any federal, state, county or city office.

Those Democrats that lost are probably decent politicians with decent
campaign staffs but they just didn't beat the Republican.

But what about all the Republicans that won an election because there
wasn't even a Democrat to run against?  How many unopposed Republicans
are there?  Could we get somebody to at least challenge the
Republican?  If any of these new Democrats won it would be improvement
and these new Democrats will gain experience to make a win in the next
election (or the one after that) more likely.

When trying to solve a problem it's always a good idea to go after the
low hanging fruit first.  An unchallenged Republican is very low.

This is much like Howard Dean's 50 state strategy but carried out from
the grass roots across every political office.  We are going to make
it easy for Democrats to get into the race.  The Democratic party is
still responsible for helping them win but we are going to make sure
there is someone to run.

## What's the idea?

I want to make it easy to answer the question "Here's where I live so
tell me all the offices I can run for" and be able to answer from dog
catcher, school board, and all the way up to President.  Then give
information about what's happened in previous races, how many people
voted, how much was spent, how to apply, salary with special attention
to races that do not have Democratic candidate.
